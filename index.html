  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Prigressive Enhancement provides a baseline of essential functionality and content to as many users as possible. Unlike the older design philosphy of graceful degradation, progressive enhancement focuses on the content itself. 
    This is a more appropriate method because it deals directly with the content of the website, which is consistent over all browsers.  This is important for modern web development because there are so many types and versions of browsers out there nowdays and we want all users to have a consistent experience with our website. I also read another article on this subject that I found interesting, which is liked below. </p>

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>During this semester, I have learned so much about building and designing websites. I also learned a lot while doing the final project and took feedback from a couple of family members into account while making revisions. There are definitely a couple things I would change if I could start over as well.</p>
  <p>Throughout this semester, I have learned so much. Though I am technically a Junior, this was my first experience with this degree field and web design. I had no idea how to write code or even how a website was built before I took this class but I caught on quickly and learned so much. I learned what css and javascript are, how to structure a website, and how to design many different website elements during this semester. I also learned a lot doing the final project.
    In doing the final project, I learned a lot as well. I learned how to make a contact form and attach it to my website as well as make the form useful. I also learned how to insert a logo into my website header and how to space the lines of text correctly so they don’t overlap. During this project, I also took the feedback from family members on my website into account while making changes.
    </p>
    <p>When I had my family members look at my website, for the most part they thought it was good and easy to use. The only criticism they had was that my FAQs page needed to be designed better. Taking this into account, I made each question a subsection and then made the answer a paragraph underneath to make it easier to read and understand. </p>
    <p>Though I feel I did a good job on this project, there are some things I would change if I could start over. I would take the time to make the FAQs into a Javascript accordion, I would make the buttons a different shape, and structure the aside at the bottom so they are side by side. 
    </p>
    <p>In conclusion, throughout the semester and during this project I have learned so much. While there are a few things that I would change if I could start over, I think I’ve done a fairly good job on this project.</p>
